With the good work by "Letâ€™s Encrypt" in providing free SSL certs for users, I wanted a quick way to check all the domains I look after to determine which ones have correct SSL certs, and which ones are in need of updating etc. 

This bash file is the first draft of a program to do that.  It can either be run against a list of file names, from the directories in your Lets Encrypt live directory or on a single server with  the aim of getting all the domain names from the server.   

The output looks like:

Domain       cert for     valid until            cert issued by    possible issues?
domain1.com  domain1.com  Dec 22 09:19:00 2016   Let's Encrypt   - certificate near renewal date
domain2.com  domain2.com  Dec 22 11:42:00 2016   Let's Encrypt   - certificate near renewal date
domain3.net  domain3.net  Mar  4 10:10:00 2016   Let's Encrypt 
domain4.net  domain1.net  Mar  2 12:23:00 2016   Let's Encrypt   - possible name mismatch


You can also get a list of domains that need to be renewed, to list the domains requiring renewal in the nest 20 days;

checkssl -l /etc/letsencrypt/live/ -e 20 -r 
domain7.com
domain12.com

You can also get it to run a specific command if domains need renewal, for example 

check -i ISPconfig -e 20 -c ~/scripts/renewssl

will run the renewssl command with the domain name passed as an argument.   If there are more than one domain that needs renewal it will call the command multiple times.   This can then easily be run as a cron to regularly check and update SSL certs.


running checkssl with no arguments gives help;

checkssl
   checkssl ver. 0.4
   checks ssl certs for a set of domains

   Usage: checkssl [-h|--help] [-d|--debug] [-f|--file filename] [-s|--server stype] [-l|--location directory] [-e|--expires days] [-r:--renew]

   Options:
  -h, --help  Display this help message and exit.
  -d, --debug  outputs debug information
  -f, --file  filename
    Where 'filename' is a file containing a list of domain names
  -s, --server server_type
    Where 'server_type' is the server type (cpanel, ISPconfig, apache2 ...)
  -l, --location directory
    Where 'directory' is where your lets encrypt live directory is
       (typically /etc/letsencrypt/live/)
  -e, --expires days
    Where 'days' is the number of days to alert if cert expires in that time period
  -r, --renew  this just lists domain names that need to be renewed.   This list could be used by an auto renew script, or to email you.
  -c, --command run-command
    Where 'run-command' is a command to be run if certificates are due for renewal. 

V0.1 initial commit by SRVRCO
